# Roadmap

## ðŸš§ Current State of the Project
- MySampled is currently in active development. The core features are established, but we are focused on the continuous improvement of the application, especially in terms of user interface.

## Upcoming Steps
- **Front-End Improvement**: We are concentrating on enhancing the user interface to provide a more intuitive, responsive, and pleasant experience. This includes revising layouts, enriching user interactions, and optimizing visual performance.

- **Adding a Tab Bar**: To improve navigation within the application, we plan to integrate a tab bar. This will allow users to quickly access different features and sections of the app.

- **Data Persistence**: We aim to implement data persistence functionality. This will enable users to save and easily retrieve identified tracks and discovered samples.
